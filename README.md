# Python-Challenge
This is my Challenge 3 Homework


1.	Title:  Module 3-Python Challenge

2.	Description:  The Python code included in this report is based on the CSV assessment of two data sets, namely PyBank  and PyPoll. Python script is provided to support each of the following requirements:

a.	CSV files for PyBank and PyPoll are read correctly
b.	Header rows
c.	PyBank=
    i.	 Total Months
    ii.	 Total
    iii. Average Change
    iv.	 Greatest Increase
    v.	 Greatest Decrease
 
d.	PyPoll
    i.	 Total Votes
    ii.	 Candidate Total Votes
    iii. Winner

3.	Usage

    a)	Both PyBank and PyPoll will have a main.py, Resources, and Analysis file. 
    b)	In order to achieve the coding outputs described above, the script sequencing for the PyBank requirements are as  follows:
        i.	Import the .csv an .os files
        ii.	Read the .csv files
        iii.	Perform the calculations/iterations needed to achieve the output requirement
        iv.	Print the final output

4.	Dependencies
    a.	Importing the correct .csv files are critical to enable code execution. 
    b.	The correct use of strings, variables, and conditions were very important with this Challenge and the ability to  obtain the correct output.

5.	Known Issues: Issues with the script.
    a.	On a number of occasions, I received a  ‘file is not defined’ error, which I learned was due to not defining the correct path for the .csv file. For example, the ‘budget_data.csv’ file is within the ‘Resources’ folder. I did not include ‘Resources’ when defining the csv_file_path.
